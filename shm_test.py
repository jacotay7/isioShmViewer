def create_image(name, shape, dtype):
    """
    Demonstrates how to use the 'create' function provided by the C++ library via pybind11.

    The underlying C++ function has the following parameters:
        - img (IMAGE &): A reference to an image object to be created/initialized.
        - name (str): A name for the image.
        - buffer (py::buffer): A buffer that must be a NumPy array containing the image data.
        - location (int8): An 8-bit integer specifying a location (e.g. GPU device index).
        - shared (uint8): An 8-bit flag indicating whether the image memory is shared.
        - NBsem (int): The number of semaphores to associate with the image.
        - NBkw (int): The number of keywords or metadata parameters.
        - imagetype (uint64): A 64-bit unsigned integer specifying the image type.
        - CBsize (uint32): A 32-bit unsigned integer for the control buffer size.

    The function returns an integer result code:
        - 0 indicates that the image was created successfully.
        - A non-zero value indicates an error.

    Note:
        - The C++ binding verifies that the passed buffer is a NumPy array.
        - Only certain data types are supported. Supported types include:
            uint8, int8, uint16, int16, uint32, int32, uint64, int64, float, and double.
          If the bufferâ€™s dtype is unsupported, a ValueError is raised.

    Returns:
        int: The result code from the C++ function.
    
    Example:
        >>> result = create_image_example()
        Image created successfully.
